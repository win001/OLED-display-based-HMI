# OLED-display-based-HMI
There are two keys for user to input. Increment and decreament. You can fill an array with any word/character to be displayed on display according to user input. There is a binary output you get on MCU gpios for corresponding array index like array[0] gives 000, array[1] gives 001 and so on and at the same time you get printed value of correcspong array index on display. Components used in this project -> 1. I2C bases ssd1306 OLED display. 2. STM32F103 3. 4 LEDs 5. 2 push buttons Driver for ssd1306 OLED Display -> https://stm32f4-discovery.net/2015/05/library-61-ssd1306-oled-i2c-lcd-for-stm32f4xx/
